    <h1 class="uppercase-text">T. M. Woods</h1>

    <h2 class="capitalize-text"> Retired USAF</h2>
   
  <p class="family big-ws big-space">My name is Terri Woods I retired from the United States Air Force after 25.5 years. I spent my whole career working in various orthopedic clinics. When I orignally joined the air force I wanted to be an air traffic controller. Unfortunately, that did not work out for me, due to having almost no depth perception and really bad vision, that dream was cut short.  Fortunately for me, I had a great counselor, and he reserved a position for me as a surgical technician. After graduating basic training, I went to tech school to learn my craft. I graduated tech school and went to my first base where I was notified that my job had changed from surgical technician to orthopedics. That was the begining of a long successful career.

    <p id="first" class="lowercase-text small-space">As an orthopedic technican in the AF, I got the opportunity to travel a lot. Over the last 25.5 years, I have moved 5 times and deployed overseas 3 times.  My first time overseas was I had the opportunity to work with United Nations, US Navy, Marines and Army in a Joint Humanitarian Task Force in Haiti . This is where I discovered that I really had a passion for helping people and volunteering. This passion for helping people in my community had remained to this day. I am currently attached to several non-profits, that I was introduced to during my enlistment.    
    </p>

    <p>My hobbies include working with senior citizens, veterens and young adults. The various organizations that I am involved with allow me to maintain my hobbies. After I retired, I decided to get out of my comfort zone, and start working with animals. I am the go to dog sitter amongst my friends.  I would like to expand on this by becoming a foster parent to small animals. This will happen within the next year or two. In my spare time, I like to read and walk around my neighborhood, when the weather is good. </p>
